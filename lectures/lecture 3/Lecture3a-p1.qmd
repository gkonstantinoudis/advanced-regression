## Classical variable or model selection

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
**Variable or model selection\
**To select a model (a set of variables, i.e. one or many variables) jointly.
:::

-   Focus is not on a single variable but on a model, i.e. one or a combination of many variables.

-   Motivation: **To understand** which combination of variables explains best the outcome and future outcomes.

## Classical variable or model selection

Measures used to compare models:

-   Proportion of variance explained

-   $F-$statistic and analysis of variances (ANOVA)

-   Likelihood based methods

    -   Likelihood ratio test (LRT)

    -   Akaike information criterion (AIC)

    -   Bayesian information criterion (BIC)

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
## Proportion of variance explained

Consider the linear model:

$y = x \beta + \epsilon \nonumber$

-   Variance decomposition:

$$\underbrace{var(y)}_{\text{Total Variance}} = \underbrace{var(x\beta)}_{\text{Explained Variance}} + \underbrace{var(\epsilon)}_{\text{Error Variance}}$$

-   $R^2$ is the proportion of variance explained by a model

$$R^2 = \frac{var(x\beta)}{var(y)} = 1-\frac{var(\epsilon)}{Var(y)}$$
:::

## Proportion of variance explained

-   How to compute? Using sum of squares (SS):

    -   Total variance

        $\hat{var}(y) = \frac{1}{n-1} SS_{Total} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n[y_i -\bar{y}]^2$

    -   Explained variance $\hat{y}=x\beta$

        $\hat{var}(\hat{y}) = \frac{1}{n-1} SS_{Explained} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n[\hat{y}_i - \bar{y}]^2$

    -   Error variance

        $\hat{var}(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{n-1} SS_{Error} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n[y_i -\hat{y}_i]^2$

        where the mean is defined as $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$

## Occam's razor

-   When comparing two models it is important not only to consider $R^2$ but also how complex they are, i.e. how many variables they include.

-   Occam's razor (law of parsimony): Simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones (William of Ockham 1287--1347).

-   Problem: $R^2$ will always increase when including more variables.

-   Question: Is including more variables actually improving the model fit significantly?

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## Adjusted proportion of variance explained

-   Adjusted $R^2$

$$R^2_{adj} = 1- (1-R) \times \frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$

-   Alternative representation with degrees of freedom (df)

$$R^2_{adj} = 1- \frac{SS_{Error}/df_e}{SS_{Total}/df_t}$$

where $df_t=n-1$ and $df_e=n-p-1$
:::

## Analysis of Variances (ANOVA)

What is a nested model?

-   Model $M_1$ is a nested model of model $M_2$ when model $M_2$ contains $M_1$.

-   $M_1$ is a subset of $M_2$: $M_1 \subset M_2$

-   Example: $M_1 = bmi$ and $M_2 = bmi + map$

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-width: 8
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(eulerr)
set.seed(11)
intersecting_inside <- euler(c("M1" = 6, "M2" = 0, "M1&M2" = 2))
plot(intersecting_inside,
  fills = list(fill = c(
    "lavenderblush2",
    "lightblue2"
  )), labels = list(cex = 2)
)

-   $F$-test, to compare two nested models: a full and a reduced model

-   $M_2$ full model included $p_2$ predictors

|                    | df        | SS                           |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Regression fit** | $p_2$     | $SS_{\text{Explained}}(M_2)$ |
| **Error**          | $n-p_2-1$ | $SS_{\text{Error}}(M_2)$     |
| **Total**          | $n-1$     | $SS_{\text{Total}}(M_2)$     |

-   $M_1$ full model included $p_1$ predictors, where $p_1<p_2$

|                    | df        | SS                           |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Regression fit** | $p_1$     | $SS_{\text{Explained}}(M_1)$ |
| **Error**          | $n-p_1-1$ | $SS_{\text{Error}}(M_1)$     |
| **Total**          | $n-1$     | $SS_{\text{Total}}(M_1)$     |

## Analysis of Variances (ANOVA)

-   $F$-test, to compare two nested models:

    -   \`full' model ($M_2$) with $p_2$ parameters

    -   \`reduced' model ($M_1$) with $p_1$ parameters

-   It will always hold that:

    -   $R^2(M1) \leq R^2(M2)$

    -   $SS_{Error}(M_1)\geq SS_{Error}(M_2)$

    -   $p_2>p_1$

-   But is the \`full' model ($M_2$) significantly better than a \`reduced' model ($M_1$)?

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## Analysis of Variances (ANOVA)

-   $H_0$: Model $M_2$ fits the data as good as model $M_1$.

$$F = \frac{(SS_{Error}(M_1)- SS_{Error}(M_2))/(p_2-p_1)}{SS_{Error}(M_2) / (n-p_2-1)}$$

-   Under the Null, the test statistic $F$ follows an $F$-distribution with $(p_2-p_1)$ and $(n-p_2-1)$ degrees of freedom.

-   Interpretation 1: If we reject $H_0$, $M_2$ fits the data significantly better than model $M_1$.

-   Interpretation 2: By adding more predictors in the complex model compared to the reduced model we can explain more of the variation in $Y$.

-   `anova(M1,M2)` command in `R`.

## ANOVA example: Diabetes data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(lars)
data(diabetes)

x <- as.data.frame.matrix(diabetes$x)
y <- diabetes$y

mod1 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + map + ltg, data = x)
mod2 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + glu + map + ltg, data = x)

anova(mod1, mod2)
```

-   It improves the model fit to add the variable glu to the model.

-   The 'full' model ($M_2$) is better than the 'reduced' model ($M_1$).

## Akaike criterion and other likelihood-based measures

**Likelihood ratio test**

-   The likelihood ratio test (LRT) contrasts two nested models ($M_1 \subset M_2$).

-   It is defined as the difference between the log-likelihoods

$$LRT = - 2 (\log L(M_1)- \log L(M_2))$$

-   Note that $L(M_2) \geq L(M_1)$ and thus:

<!-- -->

-   $-\log L(M_2) \leq -\log L(M_1)$,

    which is in analogy with $R^2 (M_2)\geq R^2 (M_1)$.

-   The main aim is to test if $M_2$ provides a significantly better model fit than $M_1$.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## Likelihood ratio test in R

-   `library(lmtest)`

-   Function: `lrtest(M1,M2)`

-   Is there a better model fit when including the predictor glu to the model?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
library(lmtest)
lrtest(mod1, mod2)
```

-   $M_2$ is marginally better
:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## Likelihood ratio test in R

-   Is there a better model fit when including the predictor map to the model?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
mod1 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + glu + ltg, data = x)
mod2 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + glu + map + ltg, data = x)
lrtest(mod1, mod2)
```

-   Model $M_2$ (including map) is significantly better.

-   Model $M_2$ needs one more parameter to estimate than $M_1$ (degree of freedom (df)=1).
:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## Akaike information criterion (AIC)

-   Akaike information criterion (AIC) combines a measure of model fit with a measure of model complexity.

    $$AIC = -2 \log L + 2p$$

    -   $L$ Maximum likelihood of the model

    -   $p$ Model complexity: Number of parameters in the model

-   The best model is the one with the minimum AIC value (minimum information loss).

-   The AIC can be used for model comparison, not to assess the quality of the model fit.

-   `AIC(M1,M2)` command in R.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## Bayesian information criterion (BIC)

-   Also the Bayes information criterion (BIC) combines a measure of model fit with a measure of model complexity.

    $$BIC = -2 \log L + \log(n) p$$

    -   $L$ Maximum likelihood of the model

    -   $p$ Model complexity: Number of parameters in the model

-   The best model is the one with the minimum BIC value (minimum information loss).

-   The BIC can be used for model comparison, not to assess the quality of the model fit.

-   `BIC(M1,M2)` command in R.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## AIC and BIC

-   More generally, we can understand information criteria (IC) as a compromise between model fit and model complexity

    $$IC = -2log L + k \times p \nonumber$$

    -   $L$ Model fit: Maximum likelihood of the model

    -   $p$ Model complexity: Number of parameters in the model

-   The best model is the one with the minimum IC value (minimum information loss).

-   $k$ defines the penalty of the model complexity

    -   AIC: $k=2$

    -   BIC: $k=\log(n)$
:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
## AIC and BIC in R

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

mod1 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + map + ltg, data = x)
mod2 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + glu + map + ltg, data = x)

AIC(mod1, mod2)
BIC(mod1, mod2)
```

-   There is no consensus between AIC and BIC.

-   Using the AIC we would prefer $M_2$, but using the BIC we would prefer $M_1$.

-   This is not a strong evidence that adding the variable $glu$ (glucose) has a lot of benefit.

## AIC and BIC in R

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

mod1 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + glu + ltg, data = x)
mod2 <- lm(y ~ age + sex + glu + map + ltg, data = x)

AIC(mod1, mod2)
BIC(mod1, mod2)
```

-   In contrast the variable map (blood pressure) greatly improves the model fit.

-   Since the variable map (blood pressure) is supported by both methods we have greater confidence that it improves the model fit.

## How to decide which models to test?

-   Backward selection

    1.  Start with the full model and include all $p$ variables available.

    2.  Identify the variable with the weakest evidence and remove it.

    3.  Evaluate the model with $p-1$ variables.

    4.  Identify the variable with the weakest evidence and remove it.

## How to decide which models to test?

-   Forward selection

    1.  Start to evaluate all models including just a single predictor variable.

    2.  Identify the variable with the strongest univariable impact.

    3.  Evaluate all models including the best single predictor variable and one additional variable.

    4.  Identify the tuple of two variables with the strongest impact.

## Alternative for model selection

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
Backward and forward selection do rarely agree. They are highly instable and there is no guaranty that they find the optimal model. It is not recommended to use them.
:::

Alternatives for model selection:

-   Evaluate all possible models: Becomes computationally infeasible even with a moderate number of variables.

    -   $p=10$ variables have $2^{10} =1,024$ possible models

    -   $p=20$ variables have $2^{20} =1,048,576$ possible models
