## Course aims

-   Understand the fundamental concepts of **data science** including high-dimensional statistics and advanced regression

-   Translate these into **real world data problems**:

    -   **Understanding** structure in complex data

    -   **Prediction** of future observations

-   **Evaluate** results of other studies and publications

-   **Design** and conduct analysis of complex datasets

## Topics covered

1.  **Understanding** structure in complex data:
    -   Linear and generalised linear models
    -   Hierarchical models
    -   Non-linear exposures
    -   Model and variable selection
2.  **Prediction** of future observations:
    -   Prediction rules and cross validation
    -   Penalised regression
    -   Machine learning (classification, trees, neural networks)

## Module structure

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)

dfr <- data.frame(
  name = factor(
    c(
      "Morning lecture part A",
      "Morning lecture part B",
      "Morning lecture part C",
      "Practical"
    ),
    levels = c(
      "Practical",
      "Morning lecture part C",
      "Morning lecture part B",
      "Morning lecture part A"
    )
  ),
  start = c(
    "10:00",
    "11:00",
    "12:00",
    "14:00"
  ),
  end = c(
    "10:50",
    "11:50",
    "12:50",
    "16:00"
  )
)

dfr$start <- as.POSIXct(strptime(dfr$start, format = "%H:%M"))
dfr$end <- as.POSIXct(strptime(dfr$end, format = "%H:%M"))

mdfr <- melt(dfr, measure.vars = c("start", "end"))

ggplot(mdfr, aes(x = value, y = name)) +
  geom_line(size = 8, col = "blue") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = as.POSIXct(strptime(
      c(
        "10:00", "11:00",
        "12:00", "13:00",
        "14:00", "15:00",
        "16:00"
      ),
      format = "%H:%M"
    )),
    labels = c(
      "10:00", "11:00",
      "12:00", "13:00",
      "14:00", "15:00",
      "16:00"
    )
  ) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

## Practicals in R

There will be an R practical following each course:

```{r fig.align='center'}
#| echo: true

x <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- exp(x) + rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 3)
ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_point(data = data.frame(x = x, y = y), ggplot2::aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  ggplot2::theme_bw()
```

## Practicals

-   Opportunity to interact with module lead and tutors.

-   Discussion of the solutions.

-   Forum on padlet for support.

-   Solutions will be released after the practical session.

-   Working on the practicals and solving the questions is the best preparation for the exam.

## What is markdown or quarto?

-   When coding in R it is important to document and comment the code.

-   Markdown is an R package that compiles R code into documents (pdf, html, word and many more).

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown>.

-   Project page <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>.

Make your code accessible and reproducible.

## Learning outcomes

-   Perform advanced statistical analyses, employing penalised likelihood or non-pararametric regression models.

-   Discuss the theoretical foundations and limitations of the most widely used advanced regression approaches.

-   Use complex regression models in R, understand which methods are suitable for which data and interpret the results.

-   Enjoy data science.

## Drop in sessions

-   Wednesdays (16:00-17:00). (709 room or South Ken?)

-   In person and/or online.

-   Opportunity to re-discuss and get feedback.

## Assessment

**Part 1. Data analysis practical:** Students will complete a take-home data analysis practical within a 24-hour window. They must submit an R Markdown along with PowerPoint.

**Part 2. Oral presentation of findings:** Students will then deliver an oral presentation using the PowerPoint slides previously submitted.

The total mark and pass will be calculated after **combining**: 25% rmarkdown, 25% slides, 25% oral presentation, 25% Q&A).

## Slides format

-   All the material are available on Blackboard and Github

-   https://github.com/gkonstantinoudis/advanced-regression

-   Check Introduction to Git course at data camp (not mandatory!)

-   Material is available as pdf and html. To get the html format as the lectures, download the .qmd files and render the document. Make sure you have

    -   All required packages

    -   Rtools

    -   LaTeX
